In the last decade I exponentially witnessed more obsession over the Black-History-Month, sadly in a more hateful way. Some people tend to complain about the white history, and when they will get the attention they think it deserves. One key aspect they might not understand, white history is the *default.*
In the textbooks, the holidays, the monuments, the movies, the lessons one grows up with. 
Black History Month isn't about *exclusion*.
It's about correction. It exists because entire stories were erased, minimized, or even never taught at all.
It's about making space for the truth.
