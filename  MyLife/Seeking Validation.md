# Seeking Validation

"Do you climb the mountain to be seen by the world or to see the world?"

This question deals a lot with your meaning behind chasing your goals. Do you seek validation from other, do you fell like you have to achieve to be noticed?

If anything is to be proven, you should question why you are doing it in the first place?

Which validation could be of so much depth, that it changes your entire life. 

Is this validation even worth it?
