# How to write good Characters





## How to make them worthy to remember

Make readers care, even in just a few pages. 
Use dialogue to reveal personality and motivation – why do they do, what they do? 
Focus on one or two central characters to avoid overcrowding. Don‘t design them perfect, give them flaws, desires and choices, which expand the story. 
Every Character should feature the four traits.

Ask yourself: "Would I remember this character tomorrow?"


## The 2 Core Features


When creating a character it helps to create the 2 Core Features. One is the character itself in a short sentence e.g.: 

*A thief, who leaves no coin behind*

The second is his appearence 



## Impact on the reader

Think about what the character should achieve in the reader. Should his effect be fear? Empathy? Happiness? 
The emotional response is a key factor.

## The four Traits

Every well build character should feature the three main character Traits: 

>Want
>Need
>Conflict


#### Want:

Want is pretty self-explanatory,  what does your character want? What does he desire?
The want can range from getting better grades to saving humanity.
If a character doesn't have a want, then he is not relevant in the story, because he is in fact not active

#### Need

The need part isn't revealed at the start, but more explained throughout the story. It is not what the character wants, but what he needs – the inner need.


#### Conflict

The Conflict represents why the character can‘t do what he wants to do. What is preventing him from fulfilling his want? 

#### Fear

The fear can be answered pretty easily, you just have to look at what the character wants: 
If his want is to be rich, so people will like him -> Then his fear is being alone
If his want is being the smartest in his class -> Then his fear is being stupid or that others assume he is.
