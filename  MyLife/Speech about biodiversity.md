# Biodiversity

Dear Ms. Doolmann,

Regarding our homework, I may have misunderstood the “sport speech” requirement and instead wrote a more detailed and sustainability focused argument than expected.

To avoid taking too much time in class, I thought it would be best to send it to you directly in hopes that it can still count toward my grade.

Kind regards,

Ansgar


There are many arguments supporting the claim that biodiversity is essential for humans, from providing the materials we depend on, to sustaining our economies, to shaping our cultural identity.
Furthermore, the best of them all is, in my opinion, the saving of our planet.
Biodiversity is the most crucial factor for our planet’s future, because it underpins every system that keeps Earth habitable, from climate stability to food production and clean water.
Human made climate change began with industrialisation in the 1800s and accelerated dramatically after 1950, leading to dramatic consequences. Still, we, as a society, do not really bother with trying to stop it, therefore we are at a point of a tremendous  catastrophe. 
Some impacts are irreversible, but mitigation can still limit future damage, if we start doing everything we can to prevent it from worsening, something that seems unlikely under current profit‑driven systems.

Biodiversity, also called Biological diversity, is all life on earth, from single genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests and coral reefs. This product of billions of years of evolution is increasingly influenced by humans, and provides us with everything we need to live, like food, water, medicine and most importantly, a stable climate.

Humanity should therefore do everything in its power to protect it. Sadly, nature is in an enormous crisis. Up to one million species are threatened with extinction. Irreplaceable ecosystems are turning from carbon sinks into carbon sources due to deforestation. Around 80% of wetlands have disappeared.

Human land use is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. By transforming habitats into farmland, cities, and industrial areas, we make them uninhabitable for countless plant and animal species, pushing them toward extinction.

Biodiversity and climate change are deeply interconnected. Climate change accelerates biodiversity loss through the disappearance of local species, the spread of diseases, and mass mortality events and even causing the first climate driven extinctions. 
Rising temperatures force species to toward the poles, disrupting entire ecosystems. 
The risk of extinction increases with every degree of warming.

The oceans are no exception. Rising temperatures increase the risk of irreversible loss of marine ecosystems. Between 2009 and 2018, Earth lost 14% of the coral from the world's coral reefs. 
Just 1.5°C of warming could destroy up to 80% of all coral reefs.


This shows how climate change damages the health of ecosystems, our ecosystems. The next question is how biodiversity can help limit climate change.

Human activities produce greenhouse gases, around half of the emissions is absorbed by the land and the oceans, the other half stays in the atmosphere.
These ecosystems, which absorb gases, and the biodiversity within them, are natural carbon sinks. They are nature based solutions to climate change.

Yet instead of protecting and restoring these ecosystems, humanity continues to destroy them for profit.
Restoring forests alone could provide two‑thirds of the total mitigation potential of all nature‑based solutions.
Not only them, but also peatlands, ocean habitats and other natural spaces, both on land and in the water are, if conserved, essential for limiting carbon emissions, and more importantly, adapting to an already changing climate.
Improving nature's ability to absorb carbon could lead to one third of the emissions reductions needed in the next decade.

Whether corporations and governments will act without prioritising profit remains doubtful.

Nevertheless we have to remember:
Biodiversity is our planet’s life‑support system. If we protect it, we protect ourselves. If we don’t, nothing else will matter.
