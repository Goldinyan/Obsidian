# What makes a good Short Story?

## Be concise

Short story thrive on brevity, which means every sentence should serve a purpose, whether it builds tension, reveals character, or advances the plot. Avoid unnecessary descriptions or repetitive dialogue, instead use strong verbs and preferably precise nouns.
**Trust your reader to fill in the gaps.**

## Efficient Writing

Focus on one central idea or conflict to avoid being to overwhelmed. 
Focus on creating tension and building up to a good satisfying conclusion, which will have memorable impact.
Maintain internal logic, even in fiction stories or in this case short stories need to take place in a logical world.
Every scene, line, and detail should contribute to the climax, in any way it can – if it wont, erase it.
Tie up all major threads by the end. A clear and intentional conclusion gives the story weight.

## Show, don‘t tell

Instead of stating emotions, reveal them trough dialogue, behavior and details. Use metaphors, setting and body language to reflect feelings. Let the reader experience the emotion rather than just read about it.
