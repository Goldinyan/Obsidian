how to build more fluid senrtences
syntatic flow

not many know what that meanse 

basic goal is to reduce friction while readers read
they wont encounter resitnace 

how can you make it from one idee to ther next 

symantic flow

syntatic flow

not as much as ideas
more how sentences are put together
how they flow in one together
strcutural differences are inmportant 
they way we structure can make ALL the difference

a big favor for your reader if you do 

TRansition 

imporeve flow
do the job telling reader how they fit in with around them 
"Many People cook their eggs in butter. Not everyone cooks eggs in butter. Some cook their eggs in oil. Some even cook their eggs in a mixture of oil and butter. There are many good ways to cook eggs"
okay paragrah but doesnt do abnything to do how they realte the senetnces

with some transitions you can see how they relate 
"TO START, many poeple cook their eggs in butter. HOWEVER, not everyone cooks eggs in butter. IN FACT, some cook their eggs in oil. FURTHERMRE, some even cook their eggs in a mixture of oil and butter. ALL TOLD, there are many good ways to cook eggs "
isnt a masterpiece but flows better 
doesnt just drop sentences 
1 beginning
2 provides alternatives
3 gives factual exapmle
4 extends dicsusing to a new end
transition words explains what the sentence is doing 

instead of leaving reader to how to process sentence 
the goal of flow
the reader to process what we write

SUBORDINATIOn

2 main types
clauses
indipendet and dependet
indipendent make sense on their own
dependent don‘t 
they have a subject and verb but still don‘t make sense 
need another clause to be conmplete

where both is there is ordination 
if paraghras are staircases
independent are individual steps 
dependent arent full steps more like little ramps 
but going up and down raps is smoother than stairs

taking advantages of this makes reading a lot better

"There are many different types of pans for cooking eggs. You have many options. You should pick a pan; decide on your preferred cooking method. You may plan to fry a couple of eggs every so often. A small nonstick skillet may be enough. However, you may opt for a small saucepan. MAny poeple have strong opinions about their eggs. its important to find the metzhod and that will work best for you."

again not offensive paragprah but each independet is a full step then priocess the next and then how they fit togther, each step a full restarrt

"BECAUSE there are many different types of pans for cooking eggs, you have many options. You should pick a pan AFTER you decide on your preferred cooking method. IF you plan to fry a couple of eggs every so often, a small nonstick skillet may be enough. However, you may opt for a small saucepan, IF youre more intereseted in poeaching your eggs. ALTOUGH many poeple have strong opinions about their eggs. its important to find the metzhod and that will work best for you."

same but insteead of indipendent have reanagraed into pairs of both indeipendent and depentde
in some ways dependet work like transition but work also on the begining and end of a sentence 
you could use an introductice dependet clause  to ease your reader to the main claim of your senrtence
or use and dependet at teh end to lead reader down softly 


MODIFCATino

modifiers are pretty versitiale bit of languages and go on diff places and do diff t hings
one best thing is impoving the flow of a sentebnce

where independet clauses are blocks of sentcen modifier are additions more info without interrupting flow ro forcing them to reset processing 

"Tim had cracked the eggs He had gathered his ing"
