its key to learning 

asking questions
and thinking citrically 
absornimg

Writing for future self 
annotationg: questions etc
numbering arg 
finding ideas 

ULTIMATE 
taking an idea and explaining it to yourself in own words 
integrate it as own langauge
your own effort to learn 


processing what you learned:


reading is 20%

the rest of learning is writing notes 
most inpact ideas and 
lot of work

no learning is slow 
wisdom is a slow process 
sabotating is fast 
undestand ideas 
better than scimming

if you write a lot you will improve 



Long term investemnt

A book is a structure about a topic

topic
 Chapters
  Arguments 
   paraghras
    sentences 
     words 


many building blocks becoming an idea 
our notes are building blocks which might become and idea. / topic some day or to larger projects 


When starting something you alraedy have ideas you don‘t start at zero you mght have toc change some but not much 



Note taking

one note for one book 
every idea noted with page number and some stuff 

firsdt layer is within context, with chars etc
but 
so what 
find the acutal meaning 
ideas, points
turn them into atomic notes

they are indepent
freed from the context doenst have to know the context to understand it 
then you can connect them to other notes 
when findign distant ideas that intelink you create smth beatuiful 
you don‘t jusit go abozut author ideas but about your own
