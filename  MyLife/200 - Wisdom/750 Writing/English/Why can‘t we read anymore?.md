> When people at _The New Yorker_ can’t concentrate long enough to listen to a song all the way through — how are books supposed to survive?

We live in a society where people can’t even watch a movie or attend a play without checking their phones at least once. Is this a problem? Of course it is. What can we do to fight against this declining ability to concentrate? What can we do to create more moments without screens?

It’s not entirely our fault — digital devices are designed to be consumed. They crave attention and will do everything to get it. They trigger dopamine in amounts that make us addicted. **New information creates dopamine — a rush directly to the brain — and the promise of new information makes the brain seek that rush again and again.**

How could books possibly compete with this — a multi-trillion-dollar attention economy — and still be consumed meaningfully?

Books are incredibly important. They shape us in countless positive ways, yet they don’t receive the attention they truly deserve. Reading a book is a slow, but deeply beautiful process: word after word, hour after hour, week after week — absorbing the thoughts of someone else. Few things can compete with that. It forces us to let another person’s ideas fully inhabit our mind.

If we define the problem, we arrive at this conclusion: Many people struggle to read books because their brains are trained to expect constant dopamine hits — the kind digital devices provide. This addiction to digital dopamine also affects our ability to focus on books, family, work, and friendships.

Let’s ignore television for now — another major issue in this so-called golden age of distraction.

So how do we fight back?

Here are a few ideas I’d like to propose:

1. No social media during the workday
 
2. No smartphones or computers in the bedroom

3. No TV after dinner — read a book before going to bed


The mind can adapt to these changes surprisingly quickly, leading to renewed interest in and deeper concentration on books.
