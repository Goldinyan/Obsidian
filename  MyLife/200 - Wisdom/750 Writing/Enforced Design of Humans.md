Since hundreds of years the life of children have been rather unpleasant childhood, even when the family itself was privileged. Most childhoods were enforced by abuse.
As a result of the world fighting for better children right's and creating more attention on child-abuse, the percentage of this happening was drastically reduced.
Im really happy, that we are at a point, in which we give children the option to love who they want, and be what they desire. Parents often don‘t align with this thinking.
Most don‘t want their children to be autistic, gay, lesbian, trans, or any other gender.
In my opinion they shouldn't have children.
*You don't get to design a human.*
You have to be able to accept their gender, sexuality, style, personality, and their opinions.
