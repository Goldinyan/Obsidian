# 30 Minute Rule

One of the worst phenomenon which can occur in your life is spending 2 days on a project, before realising you made an enormous mistake. That's why preparation is the key for big projects.

Before starting any task that takes more than a day, spend 30 minutes with a pen and paper, not coding, just thinking: "What am I building? Why? What exists?"

This will help so much, you don't even understand.
