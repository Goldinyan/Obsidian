# The Grooming of Young Children by Trump & Musk

Imagine a world where the most powerful People of the whole World are working together to influence young children to not only change the way they think but also how they act. It sounds absurd, how would any society allow this, this could never happen in real-life, right? Right?



Elon and Trump use their power of influence to change the way young people behave and think throughout elementary, middle, and high–school, which has been documented, studied, and proven to increase bullying and harm.

> The bullying rate among Virginia middle school students increased 18% in 2017 in school districts that voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, according to a study published in Educational Researcher.

They achieve this by sending targeted ads to youth demographics.
100.000 of teachers reported thousands of disciplinary reports sent to studies, which proved that there is an increase in bullying in places, where Donald Trump was elected.
Many reports of kids bullying others who said they felt vindicated in their actions because Donald Trump – the president – told them it was acceptable. 
In Districts, that have had a 10 point increase in support for Donald Trump, was noticed a 8% increase in bullying, which has **never** happened before.

>The same study found that a 10% increase in Support for Donald Trump was associated with a 5% jump in teasing due to race or ethnicity and an 8% increase in bullying.

Equally important is the way they achieve this, which is by exploiting the extremely high phone usage, to access young people's thoughts through their phone.
Elon Musk himself made massive changes to the twitter guide lines in regard to protection, even go as far as firing employees, who were fighting against these changes.
These changes lead to 1/4 of the american population using Twitter.
In Addition, Twitter also reworked their algorithmus, pushing his content and other far right content by up to 1000%, which has been measured by many different studies.
Psychologist measured and agreed that this is damaging the brains of kids.

All this is not a campaign, this is not about political gain, it is about **changing the political culture**, by targeting young people, banning books, and restricting information.




Is this a world we want to live in? No. Of course not, this is why we have to fight against this, and save everyone who is currently suffering under this System.
