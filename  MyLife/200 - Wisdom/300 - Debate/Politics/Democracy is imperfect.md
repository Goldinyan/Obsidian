# Democracy is imperfect



Values every vote same 
Popularity over compentence
Uninformed same value as informed
Woulndt ask my neighbor if im sick rather my doctor
If everyone was informed it would be good but that isn’t the case
Manipulation works

Its the end of healthy human
thinking
It treats every opinion same, and doesnt value it differently 
Like hate and fear shouldnt be in polotical bc they arent well-founded  opinions but are

Most would rather vote for what feels right not what is right so it is Easy socra doesn’t say humans are dumb but uninformed person take uninformed actions

Someone who is good at manipulation and rhetoric will suceed

They want simple answers on hard question

Plato wurde hingerichtet duecj die demokratie die er hasste
By Socrates
