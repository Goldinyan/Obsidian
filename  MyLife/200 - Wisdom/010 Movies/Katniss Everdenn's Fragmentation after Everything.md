# Katniss Fragmentation after Everything

Katniss killing Coin resolves the ongoing Climax, which some might expected, Katniss then going back to District 12, meeting Peeta and resolving in a rather "Happy End". Two movies, and still one important event is completely omitted. Katniss losing her mind. 



After Katniss shoot Coin, she is thinking to herself: "Yes, I will get executed for this". To not get tortured and get robbed of her one thing she still has in her own hands: Taking her own life. She realizes her only way out. The Nightlock pill. So she tries taking it, but Peeta, seeing this, takes the pill away removing her only chance. She gets dragged into her old room at the training center, which was completely removed, leaving only a mattress. They uncuff her and leave her behind a locker door. Alone. 

After a while she starts removing her uniform, revealing shredded body parts after her struggle. She curls up on the mattress and tries finding ways to end her life, finding one, rather bad way: Bleeding to death. The bleeding eventually stops, after showering she is being fed and given medicine. Her still plotting how to remove her from the world comes to the last option she has autonomy over right now. Eating and starving herself to death. Forcing herself to loose the Hunger Games - quite ironic.

Weeks into this isolation, she start loosing herself, singing to herself constantly, singing songs she never knew she remembered. After weeks of her still living in complete isolation and still trying to starve herself, with a few exceptions when her survival instinct forced her to eat, Haymitch walks in, saying "We're going home".

To get her into the hovercraft and back to District 12, she had to undergo medical hydration and feeding after being carried out of the room. She is getting the situation explained by Haymitch and Plutarch, while flying to District 12, that she was on trial, while she was staying in the room and that the outcome resolved in her not being guilty, because the psychiatric described her as a "hopeless shell-shocked lunatic", leading to her being not punished, but having psychiatric appointments over the phone, which she doesn't really engage in.

The first month being home, she isn't taking care of herself, sitting in one chair all day, scared to leave the kitchen/room area and not showering or changing clothes. Haymitch and her mother aren't visiting, she doesn't because she, knowing what state she is in, can‘t face coming back to District 12 herself, abandoning Katniss. If it wasn't Greasy Sae, a friend she used to trade with, coming twice a day to make meals and making sure she would eat, it probability wouldn't have ended like this.

She continues like this until Peeta comes home, her seeing him planting the primroses, she starts becoming self aware of her ongoing bad shape, leading to her immediately showering and changing clothes, burning the clothes she had been wearing.



A girl, who not only survived 2 death matches, but also a civil war in two yeas, deserves not being judged by being broken. Showing a character being traumatized is needed in movies, to also show the other sides and consequences, of so-called "Stories of Heros".
