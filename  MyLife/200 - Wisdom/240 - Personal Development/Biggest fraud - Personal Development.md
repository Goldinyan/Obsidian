# Biggest fraud - Personal Development

One of the biggest frauds in personal development is the idea that you have to fix all your weaknesses.  
  
You don’t.  
  
You’re not meant to be great at everything.  
You’re meant to know what you’re great at and align with people who are great where you’re not.  
  
That’s leverage.  
That’s collective wisdom.  
That’s how you can really accelerate progress fast.
