## Mini-Essay

How often do we come across a cool trick or a smart way to solve a Coding Problem, and then just completly forget it as soon as we actually need it? 

This, how obscure it might sounds, happens to all of us, but don‘t worry I got the solution. It just takes 1 Minute and you will remember any logic or approach like it is marked into your brain.

The Trick is: Teach it to yourself. As soon as you think you understand something, explain it. It doesnt matter if you explain it someone else or even the wall, just do it loud in your own words.

Why does this work? Its easy. As sson as you explain something to yourself, you are thinking, not just reading anymore. When you activiley thinking you remember it much better, even better if you can use your own Words and examples.

If you do this a few times, remembering will never be a problem for you anymore, you don‘t have to be smart and sacrifice hours over hours in revision. This tiny habit alone will do the job.
