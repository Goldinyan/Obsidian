# Atheist – Favourite Child of God


If there is a God, 
atheists might be its favourite.

Atheist hold no grudges and expect no miracles.
They don‘t demand signs, 
don‘t blame storms on intention, 
don‘t treat the divine like customer support.

They never claim to know what God wants, 
never speak on its behalf, 
never weaponise its name.
They're the ones who never threaten others with God, 
never bargain with God.

If a God exists, 
atheists might be the ones 
treating it with the most humility,  
*simply by leaving it alone*.
