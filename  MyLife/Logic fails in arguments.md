# Logic fails in arguments

Arguing with someone is not on who is right, it is about *identity*.
Being wrong makes someone feel stupid, ignorant or immoral, their brain stops listening.
It clicks off.
They can understand you, but this would lead to them feeling like losing.
It starts with interrupting, leading to changing the subject and Ultimately attacking your tone instead of the argument.
That's why logic barely persuades on its own. Being right threatens identity, and once identity feels threatened, listening shuts down.
