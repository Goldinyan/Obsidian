# Katniss Fragmentation after Everything

Katniss killing Coin resolves the ongoing Climax, which some might expected, Katniss then going back to District 12, meeting Peeta and resolving in a rather "Happy End". Two movies, and still one important event is completely omitted. Katniss losing her mind. 


After Katniss shoot Coin, she is thinking to herself: "Yes, I will get executed for this". To not get tortured and get robbed of her one thing she still has in her own hands: Taking her own life. She realizes her only way out. The Nightlock pill. So she tries taking it, but Peeta, seeing this, takes the pill away removing her only chance. She gets dragged 








So after Katniss shoots Coin she's thinking like: I know I'm going to be executed for this, I don't want to be tortured and all that, I'm just going to take my nightlock pill myself. She's going to bite it out of her uniform, but then Peeta sees her. She bites his hand so hard his hand is bleeding, and then the pill gets crushed. She's taken away by the guards, trying to get free and losing it, calling for Gale hoping that he will shoot her. Ultimately she's handcuffed, blindfolded, and dragged into her old room at the training center. Everything's been removed, there's just a bare mattress. They uncuff her, lock the door, and she's just in there alone.

When she goes to take off her Mockingjay uniform she is in really bad shape. In the book her burns are so bad she has skin grafts all over her body, and during the struggle all that new skin got totally shredded. She gets completely naked, curls up on the mattress, and thinks: I guess I'll just bleed to death now, I hope that's what happens. She does not want to be alive anymore after she shoots Coin, she's very adamant about that for quite a while.

The bleeding stops eventually. She showers, has a paper gown, is being fed and given medicine, and she's plotting how to end her life. Ultimately she thinks her only real option is to starve to death. She knows she's being watched 24/7, and the only thing she has autonomy over right now is eating and drinking. So in a way, the Hunger Games—she is choosing to lose these Hunger Games. She tries to quit all her meds, morphling included, but she can't stand the withdrawal, so she gives in. She thinks: I guess I'll just be a morphling addict and waste away that way.

A couple weeks into this isolation she starts singing to herself constantly. She remarks that her voice sounds splendid and she's singing all these old songs she didn't even realize she remembered. Weeks pass of her doing this, with no interaction with any other person. She's still trying to starve herself, sometimes giving in to instinct and eating some food, but overall wasting away. Eventually she realizes she's being weaned off the morphling and she's confused, thinking: oh no, the Capitol isn't trying to kill me, they're going to try to find a way to use me again. She says: at my first opportunity if I get out of here, I'm taking my own life. This is one thing I won't let the Capitol take away from me.

Then one day Haymitch walks in and says: hey, we're going home. She's extremely weak and malnourished, needs to be medically rehydrated and refed, and has to be carried out of the room into the hovercraft taking her back to District 12. She's in there with Haymitch and Plutarch, and they explain what's been going on. All this time she's been in that room, she's been having a trial since she shot President Coin. Ultimately Katniss gets off the hook because she's deemed crazy. The psychiatrist describes her as a hopeless shell‑shocked lunatic, so she can't be held fully responsible. As punishment she's confined to District 12, with psychiatric appointments over the phone which she doesn't really do.

She's dropped back home with Haymitch, still completely wrecked. Her mother, knowing Katniss is in that state, still can't face being in District 12 herself, so she abandons Katniss and goes to work elsewhere. The first month Katniss is home she doesn't take care of herself at all. She sits in a chair all day, won't leave her living room/kitchen area, is afraid to go in other parts of the house, not showering, not changing clothes. Haymitch isn't visiting. Greasy Sae, a friend she used to trade with in the Hob, comes twice a day to make meals and make sure Katniss eats.

She goes on like this until Peeta comes home. She sees him planting the primroses, and at that moment she becomes aware and self‑conscious of how bad she looks. Immediately after talking to him she showers, gets all the mats out of her hair, puts on new clothes, and burns the old clothes she'd been wearing for a month in the fire. Then we get into the rest of the story.

So you could do two movies of Mockingjay and still not show how badly Katniss was wrecked by this experience. We see her go through this throughout the entire series.
