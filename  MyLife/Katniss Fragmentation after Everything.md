# Katniss Fragmentation after Everything

Katniss killing Coin resolves the ongoing Climax, which some might expected, Katniss then going back to District 12, meeting Peeta and resolving in a rather "Happy End". Two movies, and still one important event is completely omitted. Katniss losing her mind. 



After Katniss shoot Coin, she is thinking to herself: "Yes, I will get executed for this". To not get tortured and get robbed of her one thing she still has in her own hands: Taking her own life. She realizes her only way out. The Nightlock pill. So she tries taking it, but Peeta, seeing this, takes the pill away removing her only chance. She gets dragged into her old room at the training center, which was completely removed, leaving only a mattress. They uncuff her and leave her behind a locker door. Alone. 

After a while she starts removing her uniform, revealing shredded body parts after her struggle. She curls up on the mattress and tries finding ways to end her life, finding one, rather bad way: Bleeding to death. The bleeding eventually stops, after showering she is being fed and given medicine. Her still plotting how to remove her from the world comes to the last option she has autonomy over right now. Eating and starving herself to death. Forcing herself to loose the Hunger Games - quite ironic.

Weeks into this isolation, she start loosing herself, singing to herself constantly, singing songs she never knew she remembered. After weeks of her still living in complete isolation and still trying to starve herself, with a few exceptions when her survival instinct forced her to eat, Haymitch walks in, saying "We're going home".

To get her into the hovercraft and back to District 12, she had to undergo medical hydration and feeding after being carried out of the room. She is getting the situation explained by Haymitch and Plutarch, while flying to District 12, that she was on trial, while she was staying in the room and that the outcome resolved in her not being guilty, because the psychiatric described her as a "hopeless shell-shocked lunatic", leading to her being not punished, but having psychiatric appointments over the phone, which she doesn't really engage in.

The first month being home, she isn't taking care of herself, sitting in one chair all day, scared to leave the kitchen/room area and not showering or changing clothes. Haymitch and her mother aren't visiting, she doesn't because she, knowing what state she is in, can‘t face coming back to District 12 herself, abond

She's dropped back home with Haymitch, still completely wrecked. Her mother, knowing Katniss is in that state, still can't face being in District 12 herself, so she abandons Katniss and goes to work elsewhere. The first month Katniss is home she doesn't take care of herself at all. She sits in a chair all day, won't leave her living room/kitchen area, is afraid to go in other parts of the house, not showering, not changing clothes. Haymitch isn't visiting. Greasy Sae, a friend she used to trade with in the Hob, comes twice a day to make meals and make sure Katniss eats.

She goes on like this until Peeta comes home. She sees him planting the primroses, and at that moment she becomes aware and self‑conscious of how bad she looks. Immediately after talking to him she showers, gets all the mats out of her hair, puts on new clothes, and burns the old clothes she'd been wearing for a month in the fire. Then we get into the rest of the story.
