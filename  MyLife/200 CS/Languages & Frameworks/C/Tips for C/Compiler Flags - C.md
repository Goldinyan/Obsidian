# Compiler Flags - C

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror

-std=x # Tells the compiler which version to compile to.

-Wall # Turns on every additional optional warning, and prints it to the console. Important for catching error.

-Werror # Takes all those warnings we just enabled and turns them into errors, leading to the refusal of running the code, if there is any warning. 
```
