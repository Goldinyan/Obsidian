# Key Features of Short Stories

- Very short fictional texts (approx. 300–15,000 words).  
- Usually one setting, few characters, one main event.  
- Short time span; often begins in medias res.  
- Focus on a central conflict or decisive moment.  
- Often open or surprising ending.  
- Strong emphasis on atmosphere and mood.  
- May contain a moral, criticism, or thematic message.

## Narrative Perspectives
### First-Person Narrator
- Uses "I".  
- Subjective, limited point of view.  
- Strong reader identification.

### Third-Person Limited
- Uses "he/she/they".  
- External narrator, but tied to one character’s perspective.

### Third-Person Omniscient
- All-knowing narrator.  
- Access to thoughts, past, future, multiple characters.

### Third-Person Neutral
- Objective, no access to thoughts.  
- Only observable actions and dialogue.

## Modes of Presentation
- **Reported Thought**: Thoughts presented indirectly without markers like "he thought".  
- **Interior Monologue**: Direct, unfiltered thoughts in first person.  
- **Stream of Consciousness**: Chaotic, associative thought flow.  
- **Scenic Presentation**: Detailed scene as it happens.  
- **Panoramic Presentation**: Condensed summary of longer periods.

## Additional Techniques
- **Flashback**: Reference to past events.  
- **Flashforward**: Reference to future events.  
- **Foreshadowing**: Hints at later developments.







- The conflict creates the pressure.
- The turning point is where that pressure explodes or transforms.
- You can’t have a turning point without a conflict, but you can have conflict long before the turning point arrives.

One-sentence summary

Conflict is the ongoing struggle; the turning point is the moment that changes everything.
