# **1. In medias res (No exposition)**  
### **What it means**  
The story begins *in the middle of an ongoing situation* without background information, introductions, or explanations. The reader is dropped directly into the action or conflict.

### **What it does to the story**  
- Creates **instant tension** because the reader must immediately figure out what is happening.  
- Makes the story feel **dynamic and fast‑paced**.  
- Forces the reader to **actively reconstruct** the missing background from clues in dialogue, setting, or behavior.  
- Reduces unnecessary information so the narrative stays focused on the decisive moment.

### **Why authors use it**  
- Short stories have limited space — starting in medias res saves time.  
- It increases engagement because the reader is pulled into the story from the first sentence.  
- It mirrors real life: we often enter situations without full context.  
- It supports the genre’s goal: to highlight one key moment rather than a long development.

# **2. Conflict / Decisive Moment**  
### **What it means**  
The protagonist faces a **central problem, struggle, or challenge**. This conflict is usually the core of the story and leads to a decisive moment where the character must act, decide, or confront something.

### **What it does to the story**  
- Drives the **entire plot** — without conflict, nothing happens.  
- Reveals the protagonist’s **character, values, fears, and weaknesses**.  
- Creates **tension** and emotional involvement for the reader.  
- Leads to a **turning point**, where the conflict reaches maximum intensity and something changes.

### **Why authors use it**  
- Conflict is the fastest way to show character development in a short text.  
- It allows the author to explore a theme (e.g., guilt, identity, injustice) through action rather than explanation.  
- It gives the story structure: beginning (conflict appears), middle (conflict intensifies), end (conflict shifts or remains unresolved).  
- It creates emotional impact — the reader feels the pressure the protagonist is under.

# **3. Open / Surprise Ending**  
### **What it means**  
The story ends without a clear resolution. The final situation is ambiguous, surprising, or incomplete, leaving the reader to interpret what happens next.

### **What it does to the story**  
- Forces the reader to **think beyond the text** and draw their own conclusions.  
- Creates a feeling of **uncertainty**, which fits the realistic tone of many short stories.  
- Highlights the theme by leaving the central question open (e.g., Will the character change? Will the conflict return?).  
- Makes the story more memorable because the ending stays in the reader’s mind.

### **Why authors use it**  
- Short stories often aim to **provoke reflection**, not to provide closure.  
- An open ending mirrors real life, where situations rarely resolve neatly.  
- It allows multiple interpretations, which is perfect for analysis in a Klausur.  
- It emphasizes the message or moral by letting the reader “finish” the story mentally.
