# Complaining leads to misery

Never trust a man who complains all the time. Misery loves company. Pessimism is a parasite. A man who complains all the time is not only showing you his lack of problem-solving capability, but also planting doubt inside of your mind. And that doubt is often disguised as, quote, "concern". If you know anybody that's putting doubt of your own success into the universe, cut them off immediately. A real brother will support your dreams, no matter how delusional they are.
