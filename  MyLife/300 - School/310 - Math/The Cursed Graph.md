# The Cursed Graph

Did you ever saw a graph and were like: Okay, I have no clue what im looking at. Yes, I saw exactly that. The graph isn't even that hard, but still I found it very interesting.

That is the equation:

$$
f(x) = \frac{3x^{2}-5x-2}{x-2}
$$


And to make a reference how this graph looks: 
Its looks like a normal linear equation, but it has a hole, at the point (2,7).
You might ask yourself: How is it a normal line? Its quadratic, right? And why is there a hole?
The answer is much more simpler than you think.

The hole exist, because of the denominator, if x = 2, it results in a division by 0, which is not possible, leading to the hole being created.

Why it is a linear function is also pretty simple, if we refractor it we cannot easily see why this is the case:

$$
f(x) = \frac{(x-2)(3x+1)}{(x-2)}
$$

Then can just cancel the (x-2):

$$
f(x)=3x+1
$$

Leading to a **normal linear equation**, just like this....
