"The problem with the world is that the intelligent poeple afe full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence"
-Charles Bukowski

curve shows that the most confidence have no comoetence
Mount Stupid

while learning we realise that there is more to the topic so we lose confidence 
you might get confidence while becomming better but you will never have more than the one who knows noithing 

Just as the qoute isnt from charles bukwskio
the curve has nothing to do with the danny kruger effect 
 

The irony starts


the start question

"Hos is it that people sometimes say things that are clearly wrong and yet are totally confident that they are correct"

Concept Metacognition
the knowledge about your knowledga

Choosting answer and evaluating the answer require same knowledge of the topic

study

poeple did tests in humor grammer in englisch and mathematics

sorted them based on scores in percent and then divided them in 4 groups the bootom overestimated themselve b


"If you lack the knowledge to answer correctly you also lack the knowledge to correctly acces your own performance"


the top who underestimated themselve are also interesting 


False Consensus Effect

the top evaluated ther own performance correctly but beacause they performed so adeptly, they assumed the same was true of their peers ????



many different studies vbut the quintessence always remained the same


Many other studies came to the same conclusion 

2013 event showed that the dunning kruger effect persist even when the participants expicly get told that theyre assumption is flawed


the grave mis interprets the dunning kruger effect in many ways

1:
effect is not about stupid poeple but about incompetence
absence of knowledge
everyone is in one array
it applies to all of us
