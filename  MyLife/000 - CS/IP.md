# IP

An IP address (internet protocol address) is a unique number for any device that connects to the internet. 
IP addresses allow devices to connect to the internet from anywhere in the world. Information is sent over the internet in unique chunks called packets, including the requested data and a header containing metadata. 
Routers and networking systems must identify both the requester of a packet and the sender of the packet so the data requested is sent from the correct place and received by the proper requester. 
An IP address identifies the requester and sender, both of which have unique IP addresses.

### What makes up an IP address?

There are two different kinds, the IPv4 and the IPv6.
IPv4 uses a 32-bit long identifier, while an IPv6 uses up to 128 bits in the identifier. 
IP addresses contain a network prefix and a host number. These addresses are labeled based on the dotted decimal system, which includes four octets, all with eight bits, e.g:

**Binary:** `11100000.10000000.11110000.00001000`

**Dotted decimal:** `224.128.240.8`
