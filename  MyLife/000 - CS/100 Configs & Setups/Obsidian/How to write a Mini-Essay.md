Did you ever read a nice article or saw a very informing video, with information you want to remember and keep for someday, but you have no idea how to actually do that?
No worries — here's how to turn those moments into a Mini-Essay you’ll actually remember.

## Writing the Mini-Essay

The key for writing a good and sustainable Mini-Essay is working with the three godly Rules of Mini-Essays:

>- 1 Idea only
>- Keep it short (100 to 500 characters)
>- 10 to 20 mins

There are many ways to create a good Workflow and Workspace in Obsidian working with Mini-Essays. You have to **Stay organised,** which you can achieve by using **tags** and **references** to keep this promise.
You can also **link related essays** to create a clean and connected graph.


The best way to write a beautiful Mini-Essay can vary for everyone, for me it is the so-called **3-Part Structure**:

>- Intro
>- Body
>- Conclusion

# Intro:

The intro work as a red carpet for the following essay, it has to be a hook and achieve the readers attention. It can range from 1 to 4 sentences, its main purpose is present what the essay is about, spark curiosity and provide clarity & curiosity.

This could be achieved by for example a **strong statement!**

>"Video games offer an virtual fill-in for traditionally masculine roles, simulated entirely from the comfort of a sofa"

or

It could also inspire Emotion by using emotional language to draw the readers attention.

>"Faced with tragedy after tragedy, the world collapses around you. Hope is worn to a thread, and the future looks black. What then?"

This example features *Hopelessness* and creates curiosity by using drama.

or 

You could also just use a question, a way i prefer, because of its easiness but still effectiveness.

>"Why did Agamemnon commit to the evil that set forth the motions of this drama in the first place? What kind of father would murder their own innocent daughter?"

If your writers mind is speaking to you, its also 100% possible to just write a short story, leading to the reader in the position being in the middle of the action.

Use your own stories, made up, retold or personal – it does not matter. **Stories carry ideas**. 

Just think about the point you are trying to get across, try amplifying the message. You can also get straight to the point, just as you like. You can write a story and start with the body as soon as the climax hits. You can start with a story, followed by non fiction in the second half to explain the message and idea your are trying to get across.



## Body:


A Body purpose is to explain in detail, guiding the reader over your idea – explain it just as as you understand it. 
If you're stuck, try this quick reset technique, to get back into a good writing flow:

>- Look away from the screen and then turn back
>- don‘t be the writer, be the reader
>- mistakes will become more obvious

Be logical and clear enough to get your point across and to answer the promise you made in the into.


## Conclusion:

The purpose of your conclusion is to wrap everything up, just as a great writer once said:

>"A writer who does not know when to end his work, is a writer who is not worth writing"

Nothing ruins a essay more than a sloppy and therefore bad conclusion, keep it short and simple – 1 to 2 sentences.





In the end there are many ways, choose the right one for you. There is no right and wrong, if you find a way which helps you the best but others think you are crazy for doing that – it does not matter. 

>**Do the best version for yourself**.
