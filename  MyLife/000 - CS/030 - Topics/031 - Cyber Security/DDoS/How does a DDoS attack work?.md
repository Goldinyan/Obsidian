# How does a DDoS attack work?

They are carried out with networks of Internet-connected machines.

These networks consist of computers which have been infected with malware, allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker. These individual devices are referred to as bots, and a group of them is called a [[Botnet]].

If a botnet is established, the attacker has the ability to send remote instructions to each bot, to direct an attack.

As soon as a victim's sever or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot starts sending request to the target [[IP]] address, potentially causing the server or network to become overwhelmed, resulting in a ***denial-of-service*** to normal traffic.

These attacks and their traffic can not be separated easily, because each bot is a legitimate Internet device.
