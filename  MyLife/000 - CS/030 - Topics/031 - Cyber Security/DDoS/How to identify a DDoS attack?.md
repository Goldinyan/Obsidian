# How to identify a DDoS Attack?

The easiest way to identify symptoms of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes, such as a legitimate spike in traffic, can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Traffic analytics tools can help you spot some of the telltale sings of a DDoS attack:

> - Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
> 
> - A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
> 
> - An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
> 
> - Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)

There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack.
