# Real beauty speaks kindly

If the words you speak would appear on your skin,
would you still be beautiful?
Every whisper, every insult, every careless joke.
Written around your arms, your neck your face.
Would you speak softer?
Would you choose kindness instead of sarcasm?
Would you finally think before you speak?
Words don‘t leave bruises you can‘t see,
but they do leave scars, on hearts, on confidence, on trust.
Beauty is not how you look, 
it is how you make people feel, when you speak.
So if your language would be your mirror, 
would you still recognise your reflection?
Be someone whos words let others feel lighter, 
because real beauty speaks kindly.
