3 questions 

what 
so what
how do we know


what is a analysis 

how does it work
what parts and which role to purpose of the bject


analyzing pen by seperationg pieces and telling how every piece contributes to its ability to write 

basic process remains same 


1 Step
WHAT?

document pieces 
break it down 
goal is not to see the pen but the pieces
say what you notice
DETAILS
if you wnt to talk about the authors word choice don‘t sayx 
"The autho uses a lot of scientific and technical language"
might true but doesnt show details and doesnt answwer the what question 
instead say 
"The author uses scietific and technicial works like lysis, hydrophiobic, and mitochondira"
provides more specififc detyils
thats what we are after
there is no too specific
prepare to write anaylsis
most significant details
draw readers attention
looking for paaterns
things that say chrecter does consitency 
places where viloates there patterns 
good place to find details
remember explain how the overall things functions
thing about the overall focus and purpose



SO WHAT? 

analyst goes one stepü further 
explains the siginificant deetails
and how it works
idenftify details then next step is explaining how the thing contributes to the objexct purpose
how does a scene in the advertisments makes poeple want to buy the car
often partialy explain they don‘t get far enought to explain it 
"The author uses scientific and technical workds like lysis, hydrophobic, and mitochondira. These words show that they know about science"
is not bad but only part of the job
the question is so what
why does it matter
"The author uses scientific and technical workds like lysis, hydrophobic, and mitochondira. These words show that they are knowledgeable, a move that prompts reades to trust them and believe their message"
goes a step further why details matter 
THEY HAVE A PURPOSE 
"The rhythm in this poem -- a mix of troches and dactyls -- evokes the fell of nursery rhymes. This rhythm complements the nostalgic tone of the poem, bringing readers back to their childhood"
don‘t just point out the details
explain how the work and why they matter


how they motivate the audience to do what the author wants them to do !!!!


HOW DO YOU KNOW

its important how do you know how your analysis is valid
they want to know how you know it 
if this was a math problem is show your work

thats fine but how do you know it what makes you believe
say smt like this 
"The rhythm in this poem -- a mix of troches and dactyls -- evokes the fell of nursery rhymes.. Nursery rhymes are a common fixture in early childhood literature, so the poets use of those rhythms brings back readers memory of the nursery rhymes they learned as children, thereby enhancing the nostalgic tone of the piece "
this might feel a bit of a tidius process
what mightg feel obviuos to yuo isnt to them 
by taking time to explain so ther readers know how you know
your job is to show readers things they might not see 
nobody misses it
if its obvouis still say it 



EXAMPLE

focus a video and how she commucates her persona to her audience 
"Moments of flubbed performance are a defining feature of Cowerns persona "which mixes authority with relatable solidarity" here -- in addition to "her fumbling over a" bike helmet, we also see a couple attempts at catching a marker, a poor attempt at drawing a girl on a bicycle that gets replaced with a post-production graphic, and even a miswritten equation that gets redacted with a big "oops" superimposed on the shot -- all moments that my have been more discreetly edited out in a more institutional video but that remain in order to evoke the kind of blooper-preserving editing that is common on Youtube and thereby leverage Cowern s reputation as a Youtuber and popularizer"


What do we notice 
"to "her fumbling over a" bike helmet, we also see a couple attempts at catching a marker, a poor attempt at drawing a girl on a bicycle that gets replaced with a post-production graphic, and even a miswritten equation that gets redacted with a big "oops" superimposed on the shot"
details from the video 


what this contributes to the authors persona
"a defining feature of Cowerns persona "which mixes authority with relatable solidarity"
why those details matter"

"all moments that my have been more discreetly edited out in a more institutional video but that remain in order to evoke the kind of blooper-preserving editing that is common on Youtube and thereby leverage Cowern s reputation as a Youtuber and popularizer"
and how do i know the paragraph conculses how they contribute to creating a relatable persona 





you do need to ask the questions in every but don‘t have to answer them in the same order line in example aslong as they are. there


CONCLusion

can be harder than normalk
is easy
just have to answer 3 questions
