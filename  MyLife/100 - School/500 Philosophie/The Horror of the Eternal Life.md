# The Horror of the Eternal Life


Isaacs Asimov‘s: The Last Answer


Eternal Life, that sounds good. Never dying, being immortal 



Alexander Kurdt, a physicts, at the peak of his performance. Working on research that could change the course of the World, maybe getting a nobel prize for it. But then in the middle of a scientific reasearch he gets a heart attack. Slowly falling to the ground, the pain slowly faiding away leading to s moment of peace. Until he opens his eyes and sees his coworkers gathered around him, but he is looking at his own body and realitzes. Wait I am here, looking at my own body. As an atheist he never believed in a life after death, but releasied they were right. As he waits for an angel or devil to arrive and take him, the scene slowly fades into darkness. After a while he can see a human shaped form of life in the distance.  He thinks he is in heaven, because a devil wouldnt look like a humand shaped figure of light, right? Its funny how he instantly accepts the sitatuion, realising yes i was wrong religion was right, and im now a full true believer. **Fastest conversion ever**. After slowly even the light shaped figure fades away and everything goes completly blank he thinks, i might be going to hell after all.  But then a misteriousvoices begins talking to him. 


Alexander asks him if the place he is currently in is heaven or hell. The voice just answers that he is nowhere really. The voice chuckles, after alexander asks if he is good, because he was asked this a million different times, he explains that his answer can‘t make sense to a human mind so all it can say is **I am**
