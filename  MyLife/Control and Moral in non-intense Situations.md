# Control and Moral in non-intense Situations


Never claim to have standards, which have not been tested. 
Knowing you have morals only works if they have been tested by situations, just like self-control is only mastered when being in intense, control-losing situations.
If never been tested, then these are only a set of hypotheticals.
